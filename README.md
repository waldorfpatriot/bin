# bin

This is my ~/bin directory (Mac OS 10.14.2). In the moment you find one script:
It is called aax2m4b and I use it to back up my Audible.com (I actually use audible.de, but that makes no difference to the script) files. I strip them of their DRM and put them in to a folder structure. You need the activation-byte (https://github.com/inAudible-NG/audible-activator) and ffmpeg installed.
